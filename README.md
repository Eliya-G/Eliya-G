# Who am I?

Hello my name's Eliya, I'm a former welder/fitter turned software developer. My journey of a thousand steps began from a yearning for more knowledge. Bored of huffing welding fumes and building trailers, I sought a bigger challenge. Building complex automated machines. From small little auto-clickers to building scraping spiders such binary marvels always fascinated me. 

Here is my page, where I make open-source software and show the things I've made.
